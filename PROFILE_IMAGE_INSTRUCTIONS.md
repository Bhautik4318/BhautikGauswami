## Instructions to Add Your Professional Photo

### Step 1: Save Your Photo
1. Take the professional photo you showed me (the one in the light blue outfit)
2. Right-click on the image and "Save Image As..."
3. Save it with the name: `bhautik.jpg`
4. Save it to this exact location: `E:\New folder (4)\static\images\bhautik.jpg`
5. **Important**: Replace the existing `bhautik.jpg` file completely

### Step 2: Verify the Image
1. The file should be larger than 100KB (your photo should be around 500KB-2MB)
2. Make sure it's a `.jpg` file (not .png, .gif, etc.)
3. The filename should be exactly `bhautik.jpg` (no spaces, no extra characters)

### Step 3: Update Static Files
Run this command in PowerShell from the project directory:
```powershell
& 'C:\New folder\python.exe' manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

### Step 4: Refresh Browser
1. Go to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
2. Hard refresh: Ctrl + F5 or Ctrl + Shift + R
3. Your professional photo should now appear!

### If Still Not Working:
1. Check browser console (F12) for error messages
2. Test direct image URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/images/bhautik.jpg
3. Make sure the file isn't corrupted

### Alternative: Use URL Method
If saving locally doesn't work, you can upload your image to a service like:
- Imgur.com
- GitHub (in your repository)
- Any image hosting service

Then update the template to use the direct URL instead of {% static 'images/bhautik.jpg' %}
