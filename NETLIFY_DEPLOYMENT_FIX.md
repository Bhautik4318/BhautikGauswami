# Netlify Deployment Fix

## Issue Resolved
Fixed Netlify deployment error caused by Pillow dependency compatibility issues.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Dependencies
- Renamed `requirements.txt` to `requirements-django.txt` to prevent Netlify from auto-detecting Python dependencies
- Updated Pillow version from 10.1.0 to 10.4.0 (in case needed for Django development)

### 2. Static Site Configuration
- Configured `netlify.toml` for static site deployment
- Build command: `npm install && npm run build`
- Publish directory: `.` (root directory)

### 3. Enhanced Static HTML
- Updated `index.html` with animated hero section
- Added particles.js library for background effects
- Included compiled TypeScript/JavaScript
- Applied same animations as Django template

## Deployment Strategy
- **Static Site (Netlify)**: Uses `index.html` with TypeScript compilation
- **Django Development**: Uses `requirements-django.txt` for local development with Django server

## Build Process
1. `npm install` - Install Node.js dependencies
2. `npm run build` - Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
3. Deploy static files including CSS, JS, and HTML

The site should now deploy successfully on Netlify without Python dependency issues.
